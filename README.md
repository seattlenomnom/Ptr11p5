## A problem program from Kochan, Stephen, "Programming in C 4th ed."
Create a doubly linked list and the functions printList, addEntry, deleteEntry.
## Things Done
Basic program set up.
printList function working - prints forward.
## Things to do
get printList to forward and reverse print.
## Some final thouhts
Understand the problem! Don't add goals or wants that are not warrented! This 
program wants you to see things about doubly linked lists. Null pointers in
the first and last entries. These make the solution much easier. Not wasting 
attention or concentration on getting printList to print forward or backward.
The author wants you to see aspects of a new idea. You are not writing a full
blown program. This has plagued me for all my life.
